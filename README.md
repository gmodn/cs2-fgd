# Counter-Strike 2 FGD
A WIP FGD for CS2.

NOTE: This version is for the Half-Life: Alyx tools. If you don't have HLA, there is a SteamVR Home Version here: https://github.com/Gman-HLA-sbox-modder/cs2-fgd/tree/steamvr-tool-ver

To use, Add the FGD files to the "game/hlvr" folder in your Alyx directory. When it asks to replace the hlvr.fgd file, do it.

Very Basic at the moment. These things... They take time.

Currently Includes

| Entity                        | Condition      
| -----------                   | -----------    
| info_player_terrorist         |  Fully Functional
| info_player_counterterrorist  |  Fully Functional
| func_buyzone                  |  Fully Functional
| func_bomb_target              |  Fully Functional
| chicken                       |  Fully Functional

And to top it all off, a test map with developer notes!

NOTE: The map will by default load into Deathmatch if a Bomb Site is not in the map.

I will take feedback as I develop this.
